# Program for simulating code printing in the terminal

This programme is designed to simulate code printing in the terminal with a delay. It can be useful for demonstrating code in videos or presentations.

## Usage

The script takes two arguments: the name of the file you want to "print" and the delay between characters.

```bash.
./livecoder.sh your_file.txt 0.04
```

In this example, your_file.txt is the file you want to "print" and 0.04 is the delay between characters.

##Requirements
This script only works on Unix-like systems such as Linux or macOS, and requires the bash interpreter.

##Licence
This program is free software and is distributed under the terms of the MIT licence.
